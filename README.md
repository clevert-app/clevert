Flexible cli assistant for file conversion, etc.

## Intro

Today's file convertors always focus on a few file types, they build in some library like FFmpeg and provide a GUI for users.

But in my opinion, it's not enough and we couldn't stop at this. So *cmdfactory* was born:

* To be a universal solution. You should not care about different software's different behavior.

* Flexible and extensible. Load file type supports from `profile pack`, you could even make your own `profile pack` to support more files.

* Multi-threading. Let's take advantage of all of your CPU cores.
